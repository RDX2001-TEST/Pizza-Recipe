Step 1: Make the Dough
In a bowl, dissolve the yeast in water. Add sugar if using.
Gradually mix in the flour and salt. Start by mixing with a spoon, then use your hands to form a shaggy dough.
Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add olive oil if you prefer a softer crust.
Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature, or until it doubles in size.
Step 2: Shape the Dough
Divide the dough into 2-4 equal portions, depending on the size of your pizza.
Shape each portion into a ball. Cover and let rest for another 30 minutes.
On a floured surface, stretch each ball into a thin, round pizza base (about 10-12 inches in diameter). Avoid using a rolling pin to preserve air bubbles.
Step 3: Prepare the Sauce
Crush the canned tomatoes using your hands or a fork. Add a pinch of salt to taste.
Avoid cooking the sauce; the fresh flavor is essential for Neapolitan pizza.
Step 4: Assemble the Pizza
Preheat your oven to its maximum temperature (250–300°C / 480–570°F) with a pizza stone or steel inside. If you don’t have one, use an inverted baking tray.
Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust.
Tear the mozzarella into chunks and distribute evenly.
Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil.
Step 5: Bake
Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or tray.
Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and charred in spots and the cheese is bubbling.
Step 6: Serve
Drizzle with extra olive oil, slice, and enjoy your homemade Neapolitan pizza!
